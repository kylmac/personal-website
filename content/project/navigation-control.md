The goal of this project was to design and build the electrical and software systems for a motor- controlled vehicle that could successfully navigate two laps of a track within 63 seconds. 

A camera is used to detect the carâ€™s position relative to the black line. Steering is controlled by pulse-width modulating the signal delivered to the servo motor through PD control using the camera output as input.
