The goal of this project was to design the electrical system for a motor-controlled vehicle that could accomplish three tasks:

 1. Travel 40ft on a surface with no incline in 10.0 ± 0.2 seconds.
 2. Travel 36ft uphill on a slight incline in 9.0 ± 0.9 seconds. 
 3. Travel 36ft downhill on a slight decline in 9.0 ± 0.9 seconds.

In order to meet these goals, the vehicle travelled about 4 ft/s on average. To maintain this speed, the vehicle adjusted speed based on the error between the measured and reference speed.
