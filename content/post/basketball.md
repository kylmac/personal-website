This is a post I update periodically with some of my favorite NBA moments in no particular order. Some are historic and other are just memorable plays for me.

1. David Robinson scores [71 points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199404240LAC.html) in the last game of the 93-94 regular season to edge out Shaq for the scoring title, averaging 29.8 PPG to Shaq's 29.3. 

2. Kawhi Leonard steals the ball from Ben McLemore on two consecutive possessions.

3. Tim Duncan is [ejected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2SYIrUnf5Y) for laughing on the bench.

4. Damian Lillard hitting game/series winners. Most notably against the [Rockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mejFtEY5faU) in 2014 and the [Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-M3x-eZpV8) in 2019. 

5. Michael Ruffin attempts to run out the clock by [throwing the ball in the air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqgYNPANWa0). The Wizards would go on to lose this game. 

6. John Wall hits the go ahead three against the Celtics in the 2017 Eastern Semis.
