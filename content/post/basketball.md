This is a post I update periodically with some of my favorite NBA moments in no particular order. Some are historic and other are just memorable plays for me.

1. David Robinson scores [71 points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199404240LAC.html) in the last game of the 93-94 regular season to edge out Shaq for the scoring title, averaging 29.8 PPG to Shaq's 29.3. 

2. Kawhi Leonard steals the ball from Ben McLemore on two consecutive possessions.
